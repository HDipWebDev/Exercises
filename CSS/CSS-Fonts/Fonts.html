				We have an infinite amount to learn both from nature and from each other. I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

				<h2>Cursive</h2>
				<p>
				There can be no thought of finishing for &lsquo;aiming for the stars.&rsquo; Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.

				<h2>Monospace</h2>
				<p>
				That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind. The sky is the limit only for those who aren't afraid to fly! The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow.

				Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center &ndash; an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.

				It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth. I didn't feel like a giant. I felt very, very small.

				We are all connected; To each other, biologically. To the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe atomically. I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.

				As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.

				I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets. To go places and do things that have never been done before &ndash; that's what living is all about.

				Here men from the planet Earth first set foot upon the Moon. July 1969 AD. We came in peace for all mankind. If you could see the earth illuminated when you were in a place as dark as night, it would look to you more splendid than the moon.

				The path of a cosmonaut is not an easy, triumphant march to glory. You have to get to know the meaning not just of joy but also of grief, before being allowed in the spacecraft cabin.
